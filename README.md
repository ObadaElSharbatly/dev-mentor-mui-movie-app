# Dev mentor - MUI movie app

## Overview

This is a simple movie app made with React using MUI library. We made this project step by step in this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXf60-isebOEMKJTwH5n-9BkYjH_X1yb8).

## How to use this repo

While you're using this [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXf60-isebOEMKJTwH5n-9BkYjH_X1yb8) you can find a branch for every video. For example the branch [MUI-005](https://github.com/ObadaElSharbatly/dev-mentor-mui-movie-app/tree/MUI-005) is for this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YELg7N0iaYM&list=PLXf60-isebOEMKJTwH5n-9BkYjH_X1yb8&index=6). So you can find the branch name in the video title. Every branch has only the code we made in the video so that it can be useful.

> The `main` branch has the last modifications we did, which means the complete project in `main` branch
